# 100 Days Of DevOps - Log

### R1D1: 15th Jan 2018

**Today's Progress:** Trying to connect a Vagrant box, EC2 instance and Digital Ocean droplet but keep on getting authentication failure.

**Thoughts:** Gonna try and scale back a little and only get the Vagrant box to work with the pings before I go to the EC2 instance and the droplet.

**Link to Work:** This repo

**Resources Used:** Ansible for DevOps eBook

**Missed a day due to mom's speech**

### R1D2: 17th Jan 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got local vagrant box and localhost working with Ansible, was just missing the connection=local flag. Now going to Chapter 2 of the book. Also fired up a new EC2 instance and got that working with Ansible as well using the pem file and the user for authentication is actually "ec2-user" not "root" (man I feel dumb).

**Thoughts:** Things are getting slightly more exciting now looking forward to how to use Ansible to configure Vagrant boxes.

### R1D3: 18th Jan 2018
**Today's Progress:** Making some progress with the book, was able to create multiple vagrant machines and access them via Ansible.
**Thoughts:** I need to get a more powerful PC my MacBook is struggling with creating multiple vagrant machines at once.
